## ReactJS Comment Box Tutorial
Trying out ReactJS for the first time following [Facebook's official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)

It is a basic comment box that stores comments in a JSON document served by an express server exposed to the endpoint /api/comments.

##### Setup
You should have npm and node.js installed to run the server. Checkout the [official downloads](https://nodejs.org)

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run server:
```
node server.js
```

Point your browser to *localhost:3000*

Or if you want to change the port just run:
```
PORT=8000 node server.js
```
this will serve the app to *localhost:8000* for example
